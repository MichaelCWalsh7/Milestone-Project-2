*   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - The two main colours used for the games theme are midnight blue (sometimes called dark midnight blue) for the 
        background and a light yellowish/orange colour that pairs with it quite nicely for other elements. They have a muted,
        yet playful tone that is approrpiate for this type of word game.
        -  The muted tone of the two main colours contrasts nicely with the bright red and green colours used for several 
        other elements throughout the game. Bright reds and greens are used functionally here, rather than stylistically. 
        Most users of any application will be familiar with the green for good, red for bad, concomitant with traffic lights
        etc. In the game green is used to notate positive things like long words, the users score, the play button etc. 
        Whilst Red is used for error messages with wrong words, lives left, the delete button etc.

    -   #### Typography
        - There are three main fonts in use throughout the project. 
        - The first and most noticeable font is 'Lakki ready'. It is a fun, zaney font, not good for long-form text, but
        very eye-catching. It is used sparingly and only on special elements, for example the navbar home link, the rules 
        heading etc. 
        - The second font on display is 'PT Sans'. It is used for the majority of text elements accross the website, letter 
        buttons, the words blackboard, the rules etc. It is a sharp modern looking font, it is not distracting and is 
        approrpiate for a word game such as this one.
        - The third and final font used throughout the project is 'Hind Siliguri'. On lower case especially it is very 
        similar to the 'PT Sans' font mention above. As a result it is used very sparingly on lower case elements throughout
        the project. Instead being implemented in upper case elements and buttons, where it contrasts nicely and provides a
        traditional 'button' feel that 'PT Sans' does not. 
        - 'Cursive' is employed as back-up to 'Lakki Ready' should Google Fonts fail to load, the font 'sans-serif' is used 
        as a back-up to both 'Hind Siliguri' & 'PT Sans' for the same reason.
